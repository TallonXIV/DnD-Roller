# DnD-Roller
A dice roller for DnD, complete with modifiers to add to rolls (-5 through +5), a multiplier for multiple rolls (up to 5), and a log with time stamps and a roll history (includes a clear button for the log).

For the actual application, you can choose to download the whole project if you choose to tweak settings or anything, OR you could directly download the .exe contained in the Debug folder, though Windows Defender or other antivirus may stop you from opening it by flagging it as "harmful". Click "run anyway" and you will be greeted with the application window.
